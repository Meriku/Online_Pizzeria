# Pizza Ordering Pet Project
This is a pet project developed using Razor Pages, designed to showcase basic web development skills and serve as a learning exercise. The project simulates a pizza ordering system for a non-existing pizza shop. It allows users to view, choose, and place orders for their favorite pizzas. Additionally, it serves as a practical exercise for deploying a web application on the AWS Cloud.
